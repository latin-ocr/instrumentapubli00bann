wald thou this buke I suld to the declam,
Quhilk war impossibill til expreme at schorte;
Virgill it full of sentence over au quhare,

Bot here intill, as Servius can proporte,

His hie knawlege he shawis, that every sorte

Of his clausis comprehend sic sentence,

Thare bene thereos, set thou think this bot sporte,

Made grete rag-mentis of hie intelligence.

Prologzae to Book sizth, p. 158.

Thy buke is bot bribry, said the berne than,
Bot I sal lere the ane lessoun to leis al thy pane z
With that he raucht me ane roll: to rede Ι begane,
The royetest ane rag-ment with mony ratt rime,
Of all the mowis in this mold, sen God merkit man,
The moving of the mapamound, ἃ* how the mone schane,
The pleuch, and the poles, the planettis began,
The son, the sevin sternis, and the Charle wane,
The elwand, the elementis, and Arthuris huffe,

The horne and the hand staffe,

Prater J hone and port J affe,

Quhy the corne has the caffe,

And kow weris cluse.

Prologue to the eightlc Book, p. 239.

These instanees seem to prove that at the beginning of the six-
teenth century the word was applied to compositions of a very mis-
cellaneous sort, and far different from those solemn and technical
deeds to which it was appropriated at an earlier period. This may
be further illustrated by its use in the first stanza of Sir David
Lindsay's ‘⁴ Answer to the Kingis Flyting.”
