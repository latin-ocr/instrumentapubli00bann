of the proceedings in the competition for the crown, from the
conference at Norbam in May 1291, down to the final award in
favour of Ballio] in November 12923 and besides a recital of all that
relates to the adjudication of the question of right among the com-
petitors, it carefully sets forth every circumstance relative to the
claim of Edward as lord paramount of the kingdom, and registers
at full length the instruments of homage and fealty executed under
the seals of the competitors‚ and of the nobles, bamus, and clergy
of Scossand, as well as of other persons of inferior rank, who had
made their submission to the English monarch during the period

in the Chapterhouse at VVestmhrster, and it has been printed by
Rymer, though in rather a disjointed form, under the title of

“ Magnus Botulus Scotiae.'’ (Fcedera, ii. 542.)

Another record of the same transactions, framed by a different
notary, and probably at a later period, has been deposited in the
Tower of London. It evinces equal anxiety for the preservation of
every detail relative to the English claim of feudal superiority, and
to the submission of the competitors and the people of Scotland3
and having brought down the statement to the date of the award in
favour of Balliol, it proceeds to a detail of those vexatious measures
on the part of Edward in the three following years, which acce-

lerated the crisis most favourable to his views, in the hostile but ill
