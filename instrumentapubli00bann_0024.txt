Swa thai consentyd thau
And mad upon this a ragnum
With mony selis of lordis, thare

That that tyme at this trette wa1·e.—Chron. i. p. 219.

In his account of the conferenee and compact between Bruce and
the Red Comyn at Perth, in the year 1304, Henry the Minstrel
repeatedly applies the term ragonem to what Fordun describes as
‘⁶ conventio hine inde facta ae fide media, interpositis juramentis, per

“ suas indenturas, cum appositione sigillorum eorundem roborata.⁷’

The Bruce and he completyt furth thar bandis ;
Syn that samyn nycht thai sellyt with thar bandis.
This ragment left the Bruce with Cumyn thar,
With king Edward haym in England can far ς

And thar remaynyt quhill this ragment war knawin,
Thre yer and mar or Bruce persewyt his awin.

Sum men demys that Cumyn that ragmeut send3

Sum men tharfor agaynys makis defend.
Wallace, b. x. v. 1147.

In these instances, the import of the term is obviously the same as
in the passages previously quoted from History and Record3 but in
other authors9 of a somewhat later date, the word occurs in a much
more vague and general sense. Thus in various passages of the
prologues to the translation of Virgil's AEneid by Gavin Douglas:

Gif I had not bene to ane boundis constrenst,
Of my bad wit perchance I thocht have fenit

In ryme an rag-men twise als curiouse,

Bot not be twenty part sa se1]tencius·-Pt·cface, p. 8, 24.
