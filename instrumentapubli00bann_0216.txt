tain range where the rivers Liddel and J ed have their sources, there are the vestiges of
a Roman road, called the Wheel-causeway, or the Wheel-rig, and near to which are the
remains of a Peel or small castellated house of the same name 3 and that this was the
Wyel of the Itinerary‚ and the resting place of Edward, there can be no doubt. It
must have been nearly in the same line that another celebrated journey was accom-
plished in much less time-7 that of Queen Mary, from Jedburgh to Hermitage Castle,
aud back again, on the 16th of October 1566.

In Edward’s subsequent progress from the Border, to Edinburgh, Linlithgow, and
Stirling, as detailed in the Itinerary, there occur no topographical obscurities. On
lVednesday the 20th of June, he crossed the Forth (mer d’Escosse) on the route to
Perth, (Saint Jelzan de Perte,) where he arrived on the following day, having rested

the Castle of Forfar ‚· to Fernwel, in the neighbourhood of Montrose‚ and to Montrose,

(Momzros chastel et bonne ville,) where he sojourned from Saturday the 7th till Wed-
nesday the 11th of July.

Pursuing his journey northward, he then advancetl to Kincardine in the Mearns,
and on the two following days effected a laborious passage across the Grampian moun-
taius, by Glenbervie, (Glombermz'e) to a place corruptedly written Dunnes or Durum,
probably Durris, on the south bank of the river Dee; described in the manuscripts
